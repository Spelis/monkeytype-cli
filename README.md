Test Modes: MonkeyType CLI offers a couple of test modes to challenge your typing skills. You can choose from different test durations and word amounts.

Stats: After completing a test, you can see your words per minute (WPM), raw WPM, accuracy, character stats, test length, and leaderboards info. You can also see a graph of your WPM and raw over the duration of the test.
